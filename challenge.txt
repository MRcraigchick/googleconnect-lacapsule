👉 Take the time to read the documentation to add a Google sign-in button:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-oauth/google
https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/frameworks/java/creating-client-ids#web-client

👉 Add the Google sign-in button where indicated in the code. On click, 
you should be able to log into the app and retrieve the name and email 
associated with the account. These clues will help you:

You will need to add a test user (your email with which you will test the connection) 
within the OAuth consent screen.

The response received via the @react-oauth/google module will contain a “credential” 
character string that must be decoded via the jwt-decode module: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-decode

👉 When the user is logged in, modify the Home page to display only "Welcome" followed 
by the user's name and email as on the second model.
